Title: Option Manager for R
Version: 0.0.1

Description: This option manager is similar to futile.options, except that it
    stores global options in an environment rather than in R's default option
    list. The advantage of this slight generalisation is that it allows users
    to easily define option hierarchies where options at the level of a
    function call overwrite options specified for an object, which overwrite
    options specified globally.
