Title: Lightweight and Powerful Option Manager for R
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2014-10-22
Author: Mark van der Loo
Maintainer: Mark vand er Loo <mark.vanderloo@gmail.com>
Description: Easily define option sets, and add/remove or reset options to
    defaults. This option manager is similar to futile.options, except that it
    stores global options in an environment rather than in R's default option
    list. The advantage of this slight generalisation is that it allows
    programmers to define option hierarchies, for example where options at the
    level of a function call overwrite options specified for an object, which
    overwrite options specified globally.
